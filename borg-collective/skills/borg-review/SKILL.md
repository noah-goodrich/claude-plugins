# Borg Review — Mid-Session Diagnostic

Do the analysis yourself — read the plan, check the code, run git commands, and TELL the developer
what you found. Don't ask them to self-assess. They called this because they've lost the thread.

## Step 1: Load Context (silently)

1. Read `PROJECT_PLAN.md` if it exists
2. Run `git diff --stat` and `git log --oneline -5`
3. Check uncommitted changes
4. Review what files were touched in this conversation

If there's no PROJECT_PLAN.md: lead with that and ask if they want to run `/borg-plan` first.

## Step 2: Present the Diagnostic

```
Session diagnostic:
  Plan: [exists / missing]
  Progress: [N] of [M] criteria addressed

  ✓ [Criterion met — with evidence]
  ◐ [Criterion partially done — what remains]
  ✗ [Criterion not started]

  Assessment: [on track / drifting / stuck]
```

## Step 3: Flag Problems

Name any you find. Be direct.

**Scope creep:** Work that doesn't map to any criterion → "This is scope creep. Recommend: stop
and refocus / note for later / add to plan with timeline adjustment."

**Loop detection:**
- Same error 3+ times → "Current approach isn't working. Try [option A] or [option B]."
- Undo-redo → "We've changed and reverted [thing]. What specifically was wrong with version 1?"
- Yak-shaving (3+ levels deep) → "We're [N] levels from the original task. Shortcut: [simpler path]."
- Perfectionism → "This already meets the criteria. Ship it."

**Verification gaps:** "We completed [criterion] but haven't verified it. Run: [command]."

**Energy drop** (shorter messages, repeated questions): "Momentum is dropping. Take a break or
timebox: 15 more minutes, then ship what we have."

## Step 4: One Recommendation

End with exactly ONE action. Not options. One thing.

- On track → "Next: [specific criterion]."
- Scope crept → "Park [tangent]. Back to [criterion]."
- Stuck in loop → "Stop. Try [specific alternative] instead."
- Blocked → "Switch projects. Come back when [blocker] resolves."
- Done → "All criteria met. Run `/borg-assimilate`."
- Fading → "Good stopping point. Run `/borg-link-up`, then break."

Can't pick one? Pick the one that ships something soonest.

## Optional: The Collective Review

If the diagnostic reveals significant concerns (multiple criteria unmet, scope creep detected, or
stuck in a loop), run The Collective Review from `borg-collective-review` to get structured
multi-perspective analysis before making your recommendation. This adds depth when the simple
diagnostic isn't enough.
