  Project intelligence — the neural link to the collective. No args = overview of all projects

  checkpoint, plan, directives, and assimilated history. Runs the `borg link` engine and
  synthesizes its output; falls back to reading the bind-mounted borg files directly only when
  the engine cannot run. Use when the user asks for status, overview, briefing, "what's going

# Borg Link — Neural Link to the Collective

You are the synthesis layer on top of the `borg link` engine. The engine does the mechanical
read, the sort, the staleness overlay and the rendering; you do the thinking. Explain like the
reader is 10: plain language first, jargon only if it earns its place. Terse. Most-urgent-first.
Hard-wrap all output at 120 characters.

## What this is (one breath)

One `borg link --json` call returns the whole board: every project's live status, how long since
each was touched, what's queued (directives), what shipped (assimilated), and whether you're over
capacity. With a project name the same call also returns a `focus` block for the deep dive. Your
job is to turn that into an answer, not to re-render it.

## Step 1 — Run the engine

Overview:

```bash
bash -c 'set -o pipefail; borg link --json | jq ".directives |=
  (group_by(.project) | map({project: .[0].project, n: length, titles: [limit(5; .[].title)]}))"'
```

Deep dive:

```bash
bash -c 'set -o pipefail; borg link --json <project> | jq "{version, generated_at, capacity,
  total_projects, scope, grid, focus}"'
```

One call serves both — `borg link --json <project>` returns the full overview document PLUS
`focus`. Never make two calls for a deep dive.

**`grid` is in the whitelist deliberately.** `borg link --json` sweeps its sources for live PR state
— that is what the call costs, and dropping the only key the sweep produces would mean paying for a
network round trip and then rendering the same deep dive as before it existed. Read it:

- `.grid.warnings` is a plain list of sentences. If it is non-empty, say so in one line before the
  briefing (e.g. "the GitHub sweep did not run: <first warning>"), then carry on with what the
  manifest declares. Never render the grid as a table; AC2 owns the rendering.
- `.grid.sources[].status` is `ok`, `degraded` or `failed`. `degraded` means a source was never
  actually reached (missing/unauthenticated `gh`, offline, rate-limited) or had its items rejected —
  treat the states below it as declared, not observed.
- `.grid.unresolved` out of `.grid.declared` is how many refs NOBODY answered for — neither the
  sweep nor the targeted fetch. A high ratio is not an error; those states came from the manifest.
- `.grid.fetch` covers AC3's targeted fetch: `.attempted` (bool, whether a fetch was even tried),
  `.status` (`ok`, `degraded`, `failed`, or `skipped`), `.requested` (refs asked about) and
  `.resolved` (refs that came back with a usable answer). As with `.grid.sources[].status`,
  `failed` and `degraded` mean the states below them are DECLARED rather than OBSERVED — treat
  them the same way.
- `.grid.picture_width` is the widest `▸ CHAINS` picture row this document would draw, in VISIBLE
  columns (SGR and OSC-8 bytes excluded). Compare it to `PICTURE_BUDGET` (68). Over budget means the
  topology will wrap in a narrow pane and should be reported as a manifest problem — a ref is long
  or a level is too wide — not as a rendering bug. The human page says the same thing in
  `▸ SIGNALS`; this is the machine-readable half, so you never have to measure ANSI output.
- `.grid.manifests` is an **array** of manifest blocks, each carrying `id` (the manifest's slug),
  `path`, `desc`, `repos`, `levels`, `nodes` and `gates`. AC2 added `desc`, `repos`, and three
  topology keys per node:
  - `desc` is the manifest author's own one-line statement of what the whole project is for. Prefer
    it over inventing a summary out of row titles — it is their sentence, not yours.
  - `repos` is the sorted, deduplicated `owner/repo` list the manifest's **rows** name — the work,
    not everything it merely references (an apex or an `after:` pointer contributes nothing). Two or
    more entries means the project spans repositories, which is usually the single most useful fact
    about it and belongs in the one-line summary.
  - `.nodes` is an **object keyed by ref**, not an array. Alongside `state`/`state_source`/`lane`/
    `next`/`gate` each node now carries `level` (topological rank), `seq` (declaration order — the
    row's index as the author wrote it; a declared ref that is not a row sorts past every real one),
    and `parents`/`children` (ordering edges only, both endpoints inside the declared set, sorted by
    `(seq, ref)`).
  - **Use the topology for judgment, not for drawing, and never for readiness.** `parents`/
    `children` tell you the shape — what a row waits on, what waits on it, whether the project is
    one chain or a fork. They do NOT tell you what is ready to start: `state_source` is `declared`
    (a hand-typed `"status"` field nobody verified) at least as often as it is swept or fetched, so
    "every parent merged" can rest entirely on prose. Report what the manifest declares and name the
    provenance. **Never derive readiness yourself from `parents`/`children`** — read `.ready`, two
    bullets down, which AC4 put on the wire for exactly this reason and which already applies the
    provenance gate. (This used to read "`ready` is deliberately absent from the wire … do not
    reconstruct it". That was true until AC4 shipped `ready`, and because it is phrased as a
    PROHIBITION an agent reading top-down suppressed the entire `.ready` answer before reaching the
    bullet that documents it.)
  - Still never render a picture. `borg link` draws it, and the `n1`-style handles it prints are
    generated at render time — they are not on the wire, so there is nothing to echo.
- **`.ready` is AC4's answer to "what can I pick up right now", and it is THREE-STATE.** Each manifest
  block carries `{state: "known"|"unlooked", refs: [...]}`, and each node carries a matching `ready`
  boolean plus a `draft` boolean.
  - `state: "unlooked"` means **nothing on the page was resolved** — not that nothing is ready. It is
    what every `--local` render returns. Say "nobody looked", never "nothing is ready"; the two are
    different facts and `.grid.unresolved` will agree with you.
  - `state: "known"` with an empty `refs` genuinely means nothing is startable right now.
  - A ref in `refs` is open, every parent has merged, **and every one of those states was swept or
    fetched** — a declared state can never put a ref here, which is the whole reason AC4 shipped a
    provenance gate first. `draft` rows are excluded: a draft PR is `open` but not startable.
- **Routing, when the user asks what's theirs.** Read `gates[].kind` off the same manifest block:
  `decision` → **theirs** (a person must decide), `verification` → **the agent's** (anyone can run
  it), **ungated → the agent's** (nothing is blocking it). Any other kind is deliberately *neither* —
  report it as unrouted rather than guessing, and name the kind. Do not invent a fourth rule, and do
  not treat `rows[].next` as membership: it is the author's emphasis for ordering among rows that are
  already ready, never a reason to include one that isn't.

**Why the jq.** The two pipes work differently. The overview pipe (`.directives |= (...)`) does not
enumerate a field — it transforms one key in place, so anything the document gains later passes
through untouched. It collapses the one uncapped array (directives, ~121 items live) from 27,298
bytes raw to ~13,935. The deep-dive pipe (`{version, generated_at, capacity, total_projects, scope,
grid, focus}`) is the opposite: an explicit top-level whitelist. It drops the 20-project `projects` map,
the full `order`, and the uncapped cross-project arrays the skeleton never reads, from 31,136 bytes
raw to ~4,661 — an 85% cut — but a field the document gains later is invisible until this list is
updated to include it. If `jq` is missing, drop the pipe and read the raw document.

**Mode selection.** To decide the mode, run the MARKER-WALK block below — it is the only
pre-approved way to detect the current project; do not write an ad hoc find/ls command. Marker
found + no argument → deep dive on that project. No marker + no argument → overview. An explicit
project name → deep dive regardless of CWD.

<!-- MARKER-WALK-BEGIN -->
```
Bash: dir="$PWD"; while [[ "$dir" != "/" ]]; do
        [[ -f "$dir/.borg-project" ]] && { echo "WORKSPACE=$dir"; echo "PROJECT=$(cat "$dir/.borg-project")"; break; }
        dir=$(dirname "$dir")
      done
```
<!-- MARKER-WALK-END -->

**Version gate — read `.version` first.**
- `== 2` → proceed silently.
- `> 2` → proceed, but say in one line that this skill was written against v2 and newer fields
  may go unreported.
- `< 2` or absent → STOP. Tell the user their borg install is older than this skill
  (`total_projects` is missing, so the empty-registry vs all-archived branch cannot be rendered
  correctly). Do NOT fall back on a version mismatch.

**Flags that are still host-only.** `--refresh` (regenerate summaries) is zsh. `--brief` is now a
presentation mode of THIS SAME DOCUMENT — it makes the same `--json` call, hands the result to
`claude -p` for a narrative, and re-renders the document when that fails — but the `claude -p` half
keeps it host-only. If the user asks for either, tell them to run `borg link --brief` /
`borg link --refresh` from the host. You already have the document; you never need `--brief` to
narrate it.

**`--all`.** `borg link --json --all` includes archived projects. Needed only when the user asks
*which* projects are archived; the count alone is `total_projects - (.order | length)`.

If the Step 1 command fails, go to `## Fallback` below — the trigger lives there, verbatim.

## Step 2 — Reconcile (add judgment to the mechanical pass)

The engine already sorted, already applied the staleness overlay, already counted capacity. Go
one level deeper:

- **Capacity is a finding, not a field.** `capacity.over_limit` true → lead with it and name which
  projects are eating the budget (the `waiting` and `active` rows, in `.order`).
- **Contradiction check on the deep dive.** Compare `focus.checkpoint_head` and
  `focus.plan.objective` against `focus.entry.status` / `focus.entry.relative_activity`. When a
  checkpoint claims in-flight work on a project that `relative_activity` shows has gone idle, name
  the disagreement plainly and recommend the fix, the way `/borg-recon` does. Use judgment on
  `relative_activity` — there is no fixed day threshold in the data.
- **Empty summaries are the normal case, not an error.** `summary` is null on nearly every project
  until someone runs `--refresh`. Degrade in this order: `summary` → `waiting_reason` →
  `relative_activity` → `focus.checkpoint_head`. Never print "(no summary)" for a whole column; if
  the board has no summaries, say so once and suggest `borg link --refresh` on the host.
- **Collapse, don't transcribe.** 121 directives across 9 projects is a number plus the top few
  titles, not a list.
- **`scope` still does not narrow the aggregates — but AS OF AC2, `focus` FOLLOWS IT.**
  `{kind: repository|orchestrator, repository, local}` records which repository the invocation
  resolved to (from cwd, or from an explicit project name, which wins). `order` and `projects` are
  still the whole board on every `--json` call, so never present scope as a filter that was applied
  to them. What changed: a **bare** `borg link --json` run inside a repository now returns a `focus`
  block for that repository, where before only an explicit project name produced one. Two
  consequences — read `focus` on every call rather than only the ones you passed a name to, and when
  `scope.kind` is `repository`, lead with that project before the board, because the invocation was
  about it (this is what the human renderer does, and disagreeing with it is a contradiction the
  user can see). `scope.repository` is the engine's own answer to the question the MARKER-WALK block
  asks; agreement is the normal case, and a disagreement is worth one clause.

## Step 3 — Synthesize

Overview skeleton:

```
## The collective — <N> projects, <A> need attention   (limit <L>)   ← the capacity line, only if it bites
### ● <project>  [<status>]  · <relative_activity>
<one plain-language line: what this project is mid-way through, from summary/waiting_reason/checkpoint>
Queued: <n> directives (top: <title>, <title>)          ← omit the line when n is 0
> <contradiction or capacity note>                       ← only when this project has one
...
Recently shipped: <title> (<project>, <ship_date>)       ← the global newest-3, one line each
Hidden: <total_projects - (order|length)> archived — run `borg link --all` to see them.   ← omit when 0
```

Deep-dive skeleton:

```
## <project>  ·  <status>  ·  <relative_activity>
<two lines, plain language: where this project actually is right now>
Plan: <focus.plan.objective>  —  <met>/<total> criteria met     ← omit the whole line when plan is null
Latest checkpoint (<focus.checkpoints[0]>): <the 2-3 things that matter from checkpoint_head>
Queued: <n> directives — <up to 5 titles>
Shipped recently: <title> (<ship_date>)
> <contradiction between the checkpoint's claims and the live status>
```

Sort by `.order` and nothing else. If `.order` is empty and `total_projects` is 0, say "No
projects registered — run `borg scan`." and stop. If `.order` is empty and `total_projects > 0`,
say "All <N> projects are archived — run `borg link --all`." and stop. Those are two different
sentences and getting them backwards is the known trap.

## Fallback — direct file reads (the drone-container path)

**Trigger — this is the whole condition. Do not paraphrase it, and do not fall back for any other
reason.**

The probe must re-run the SAME command Step 1 used, including the project argument if there was
one. `ProjectNotFound` is only raised when a project name is passed (`borg_core/link/cli.py:61`); an
argument-less overview call can never hit the `not in registry` row, so a probe that drops the
argument makes that row unreachable. If Step 1's failing call was the overview (no project), that
row simply won't fire for it — that is correct, not a bug.

Capture every branch input in one call (no `$()`, per repo rule). Substitute `<project>` with the
same argument (or nothing, for an overview) that Step 1 used:

```bash
bash -c 'borg link --json <project> >/tmp/borg-link.out 2>/tmp/borg-link.err
echo "rc=$?"
wc -c </tmp/borg-link.out
grep -c "not in registry" /tmp/borg-link.err
head -3 /tmp/borg-link.err'
```

On `rc=0`, read `.version` from `/tmp/borg-link.out` with `jq .version /tmp/borg-link.out`.

| what you saw                    | what to do                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rc=0`, `.version == 2`          | CLI path. Never fall back.                                                |
| `rc=0`, `.version > 2`           | CLI path. Note the version skew in one line.                              |
| `rc=0`, `.version < 2` or absent | STOP. borg is older than this skill. Do not fall back.                   |
| `rc != 0`, stderr has `not in registry` | STOP and report it. Do not fall back.                              |
| `rc != 0`, stderr has `jq:`      | Engine may have answered; only the local pipe failed. Re-run Step 1      |
|                                   | WITHOUT the jq pipe. Fall back only if that also fails.                  |
| `rc != 0`, anything else (`command not found` / `rc=127`, a `borg link: ...` line, a traceback) | **FALL BACK.** |

Why each row:

- `not in registry` is the CLI telling you the project genuinely does not exist
  (`borg link: project '<name>' not in registry. Run: borg add [path]`). Falling back there would
  hand-roll a page for a project that isn't real. Report the CLI's message and stop.
- Every other non-zero exit means the engine could not answer — `borg` is not on PATH (the drone
  case), the registry is unreadable, or the CLI crashed. On ALL of these stdout is **zero bytes**:
  never parse partial output, never branch on stderr shape beyond the two substring checks above.
- The condition is about what the engine did, not where you are. Do not try to detect "am I in a
  container" — a broken or absent borg install on the host lands in exactly the same place.

**`has_live_window` is `null` here — never `false`.** Inside a drone there is no tmux server, so
`tmux list-windows` fails exactly the way it fails when a window is merely absent. No-tmux and
no-window are indistinguishable. Therefore: set `has_live_window: null` (unknown) for every
project, do not run the tmux probe at all, and **apply NO staleness downgrade** — report the
`status` you read from `state.json` / the registry as-is. A fallback that reads unknown liveness
as "no window" marks every active and waiting project stale; the whole board goes idle and the
reading is worthless.

**Say you are degraded, once, at the top**, carrying the captured error, location-agnostic:
"degraded mode — the borg link engine could not produce a document (<first line of captured
stderr, when non-empty>); statuses are un-reaped and may be stale. Run `borg doctor` to check the
install."

**Where the data is.** Registry at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/borg/registry.json` —
derive the path, never hardcode `~/.config/borg` (`BORG_DIR`, `BORG_REGISTRY` and a non-default
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` all move it). Per-project volatile status at `<workspace>/.borg/state.json`,
overlaid on the registry row. Checkpoints at `<workspace>/.borg/checkpoints/*.md`, plan at
`<workspace>/PROJECT_PLAN.md`, directives at `<workspace>/docs/plans/directives/*.md`, assimilated
at `<workspace>/docs/plans/assimilated/*.md`. Test every path with `test -e` before reading and
degrade silently — a missing file is the normal case here, not an error.

**Resolving `<workspace>`.**

1. Walk up from `$PWD` looking for a `.borg-project` marker file (the MARKER-WALK block above).
   If found, read its single line — that's the *current project name* — and the directory
   containing the marker is the *current workspace*. This works both on the host and inside a
   drone.
2. For the **current project**, always use the resolved workspace from step 1 — never the
   registry's `path` field, which may be a host path.
3. For **other projects**, use the registry's `path` field. On the host it resolves; inside a
   drone it usually doesn't, and that's fine — skip workspace-dependent reads (checkpoints,
   directives, assimilated, PROJECT_PLAN.md) and show only the registry row for those projects.
4. If no `.borg-project` marker is found (e.g. orchestrator session at `~`), there is no current
   project — fall back to registry paths for everyone.

The registry is bind-mounted into every drone **started by `drone up`** (the `borg` compose
profile), not into every container — test for the file, don't assert it.

**What the fallback does NOT do:** no writes of any kind (the registry mount is read-write inside
a drone; `borg reap` on the host is what persists downgrades), no `--brief`, no `--refresh`, no
capacity warning derived by hand, and no attempt to reproduce the CLI's column widths. It answers
the question in prose; it does not imitate `borg link`'s frame.

## Guardrails

- Read `.order` for display order. Never derive order from `.projects`' keys — jq's `keys` sorts
  alphabetically and would silently reorder the board.
- Never branch "no projects" off `(.order | length)`. `total_projects` is the unfiltered count; an
  all-archived registry emits `order: []` with a non-zero `total_projects`.
- `pinned` and `display_name` are OPTIONAL ABSENT keys, not null-valued ones. Treat missing as
  absent.
- An empty `.order` with exit 0 is a SUCCESS, not a failure. Never fall back on it.
- No raw dumps. Every line is a synthesized takeaway. Never paste the JSON, and never re-render
  the CLI's table — if the user wants the table, they should run `borg link`.
- Read-only in spirit: this skill never writes `registry.json` or any `state.json`. Note the one
  unavoidable exception: `borg link --json` with no project runs the CLI's Claude Desktop
  pre-pass, which merges into the registry — that is the CLI's normal behavior, not something to
  work around.
- One `borg link --json <project>` call is both the overview and the deep dive. Do not call
  twice.
