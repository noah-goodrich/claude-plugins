#
# THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS: cairn's decommission (see ~/dev/cairn/docs/research/README.md) leaves
# auto-memory (~/.claude/projects/*/memory/*.md) as the sole cross-session knowledge layer. Nobody
# has ever checked whether it is actually READ — 283 files / 723,639 bytes with no hit-log
# equivalent to cairn-hits.log. This closes that gap with the same instrument, so the fallback
# cannot become a second write-only store unnoticed.
#
# Pre-registered null (do not move this bar after seeing the number): <0.2 reads/session means
# auto-memory is not a working retrieval loop.
#
# Fires on every Read call; matches only paths under a project's memory/ directory so normal file
# reads are not logged. Always exits 0 — this is passive observation, never a gate.
